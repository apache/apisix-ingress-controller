## Highlights

**Add Gateway API Extensions `apisix.apache.org/v1alpha1`**

Enable additional features not included in the standard Kubernetes Gateway API, developed and maintained by Gateway API implementers to extend functionality securely and reliably.

* GatewayProxy: Defines connection settings between the APISIX Ingress Controller and APISIX, including auth, endpoints, and global plugins. Referenced via parametersRef in Gateway, GatewayClass, or IngressClass

* BackendTrafficPolicy: Defines traffic management settings for backend services, including load balancing, timeouts, retries, and host header handling in the APISIX Ingress Controller.

* Consumer: Defines API consumers and their credentials, enabling authentication and plugin configuration for controlling access to API endpoints.

* PluginConfig: Defines reusable plugin configurations that can be referenced by other resources like HTTPRoute, enabling separation of routing logic and plugin settings for better reusability and manageability.

* HTTPRoutePolicy: Configures advanced traffic management and routing policies for HTTPRoute or Ingress resources, enhancing functionality without modifying the original resources.

**Support APISIX Standalone API-Driven Mode (Experimental)**

> This mode is experimental, please do not rely on it in your production environment. We use it to validate certain specific workloads and if it is appropriate we will turn it into an officially supported feature, otherwise it will be removed.

In this mode, there is no need to maintain an ETCD cluster. Routing rules are stored entirely in memory and can be updated through the API.

You can enable this mode in Apache Ingress configuration file by specifying:

```yaml
provider:
  type: "apisix-standalone"
```

**For major changes introduced in this release, refer to the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/apache/apisix-ingress-controller/blob/0db882d66d5b9dfb7dc9dd9d2045d4709b1c6ed2/docs/upgrade-guide.md#upgrading-from-1xx-to-200-key-changes-and-considerations).**
