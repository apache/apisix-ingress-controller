apisix ingress controller e2e test suites
=========================================

For running e2e test cases, a Kubernetes cluster is required, [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) is a good choice to build k8s cluster in development environment.

Scaffold
---------

a e2e test scaffold is prepared to run test cases easily. The source codes are in directory `test/e2e/scaffold`, it builds necessary running environment:

* Create a brand new namespace;
* Create etcd deployment and etcd service in the specified namespace;
* Create apisix deployment and apisix service in the specified namespace (note both the control plane and data plane are created);
* Create apisix-ingress-controller deployment in the specified namespace;
* Create a http server with [kennethreitz/httpbin](https://hub.docker.com/r/kennethreitz/httpbin/) as the upstream.

The above mentioned steps are run before each case starts and all resources will be destroyed after the case finishes.

Plugins
-------

Test cases inside `plugins` directory test the availability about APISIX plugins.

Features
--------

Test caes inside `features` directory test some features about APISIX, such as traffic-split, health check and so on.
