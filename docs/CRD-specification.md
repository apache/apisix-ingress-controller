# CRD specification

In order to control the behavior of the proxy ([Apache APISIX](https://github.com/apache/apisix)), the following CRDs should be defined.

## CRD Types

- [ApisixRoute](#apisixroute)
- [ApisixService](#apisixservice)
- [ApisixUpstream](#apisixupstream)
- [ApisixTls](#apisixtls)

## ApisixRoute

`ApisixRoute` corresponds to the `Route` object in Apache APISIX. The `Route` matches the client's request by defining rules,
then loads and executes the corresponding plugin based on the matching result, and forwards the request to the specified Upstream.
To learn more, please check the [Apache APISIX architecture-design docs](https://github.com/apache/apisix/blob/master/doc/architecture-design.md#route).

Structure example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apisix.apache.org/v1
kind: ApisixRoute
metadata:
  name: httpserverRoute
  namespace: cloud
spec:
  rules:
  - host: test.apisix.apache.org
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: httpserver
          servicePort: 8080
        path: /hello*
        plugins:
          - name: limit-count
            enable: true
            config:
              count: 2
              time_window: 60
              rejected_code: 503
              key: remote_addr
```

**Support partial `annotation`**

Structure example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apisix.apache.org/v1
kind: ApisixRoute
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.apisix.apache.org/ingress.class: apisix_group
    k8s.apisix.apache.org/ssl-redirect: 'false'
    k8s.apisix.apache.org/whitelist-source-range:
      - 1.2.3.4/16
      - 4.3.2.1/8
  name: httpserverRoute
  namespace: cloud
spec:
```

|         Field                                  |    Type    |                       Description                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `k8s.apisix.apache.org/ssl-redirect`           | boolean    | Whether to force http redirect to https. `ture`: means to force conversion to https, `false`: means not to convert.   |
| `k8s.apisix.apache.org/ingress.class`          | string     | Grouping of ingress.                                               |
| `k8s.apisix.apache.org/whitelist-source-range` | array      | Whitelist of IPs allowed to be accessed.                           |

## ApisixService

`ApisixService` corresponds to the `Service` object in Apache APISIX.
A `Service` is an abstraction of an API (which can also be understood as a set of Route abstractions). It usually corresponds to the upstream service abstraction. Between `Route` and `Service`, usually the relationship of N:1.
To learn more, please check the [Apache APISIX architecture-design docs](https://github.com/apache/apisix/blob/master/doc/architecture-design.md#service).

Structure example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apisix.apache.org/v1
kind: ApisixService
metadata:
  name: httpserver
  namespace: cloud  
spec:
  upstream: httpserver
  port: 8080
  plugins:
    - name: limit-count
      enable: true
      config:
        count: 2
        time_window: 60
        rejected_code: 503
        key: remote_addr
```

|     Field     |  Type    | Description    |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
| upstream      | string   | The name of the upstream service.    |
| port          | int      | The port number of the upstream service.    |
| plugins       | array   | Custom plugin collection (Plugins defined in the `service` level). For more plugin information, please refer to the [Apache APISIX plugins docs](https://github.com/apache/apisix/tree/master/doc/plugins). |
| name          | string   | The name of the plugin. For more information about the example plugin, please check the [limit-count docs](https://github.com/apache/apisix/blob/master/doc/plugins/limit-count.md#Attributes).    |
| enable        | boolean  | Whether to enable the plugin, `true`: means enable, `false`: means disable.      |
| config        | object   | Configuration of plugin information. Note: The check of configuration schema is missing now, so please be careful when editing.    |

## ApisixUpstream

`ApisixUpstream` corresponds to the `Upstream` object in Apache APISIX.
Upstream is a virtual host abstraction that performs load balancing on a given set of service nodes according to configuration rules.
Upstream address information can be directly configured to `Route` (or `Service`). When Upstream has duplicates, you need to use "reference" to avoid duplication.
To learn more, please check the [Apache APISIX architecture-design docs](https://github.com/apache/apisix/blob/master/doc/architecture-design.md#upstream).

Structure example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apisix.apache.org/v1
kind: ApisixUpstream
metadata:
  name: httpserver
  namespace: cloud
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      loadbalancer: roundrobin
```

|     Field     |  Type    | Description    |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
| ports         | array    | Custom upstream collection.   |
| port          | int      | Upstream service port number.    |
| loadbalancer  | string/object   | The load balance algorithm of this upstream service, optional value can be `roundrobin` or `chash`.  |

## ApisixTls

`ApisixTls` corresponds to the SSL load matching route in Apache APISIX.
To learn more, please check the [Apache APISIX architecture-design docs](https://github.com/apache/apisix/blob/master/doc/architecture-design.md#router).

Structure example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apisix.apache.org/v1
kind: ApisixSSL
metadata:
  name: duiopen
spec：
  hosts:
  - asr.duiopen.com
  - tts.duiopen.com
  secret:
    name: all.duiopen.com
    namespace: cloud
```

|     Field     |  Type    | Description                     |
|---------------|----------|---------------------------------|
| hosts         | array    | The domain list to identify which hosts (matched with SNI) can use the TLS certificate stored in the Secret.  |
| secret        | object   | The definition of the related Secret object with current ApisixTls object.                               |
| name          | string   | The name of secret, the secret contains key and cert for `TLS`.       |
| namespace     | string   | The namespace of secret , the secret contains key and cert for `TLS`.  |
