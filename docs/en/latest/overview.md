APISIX Ingress Controller is a [Kubernetes ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) using [Apache APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org) as the high performance reverse proxy.

APISIX Ingress Controller can be configured using the native Kubernetes Ingress or Gateway API, as well as with APISIXâ€™s own declarative and easy-to-use custom resources. The controller translates these resources into APISIX configuration.

See the [Getting Started tutorials](./getting-started/get-apisix-ingress-controller.md) to set up and start using the APISIX Ingress Controller.

## Features

To summarize, APISIX ingress controller has the following features:

- Declarative configuration with CRDs.
- Supports native Kubernetes Ingress v1 and Gateway API.
- Supports service discovery through Kubernetes Service.
- Supports load balancing based on pods (Upstream nodes).
- Rich [Plugins](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/next/plugins/batch-requests/) with [custom Plugin](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/next/plugin-develop/) support.

## Get involved

You can contribute to the development of APISIX ingress controller. See [Development guide](./developer-guide.md) for instructions on setting up the project locally.

See the [Contribute to APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/general/contributor-guide/) section for details on the contributing flow.

## Compatibility with APISIX

The table below shows the compatibility between APISIX ingress controller and the APISIX proxy.

:::note

APISIX Ingress Controller 2.0.0+ support the [APISIX Standalone API-driven Mode](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/deployment-modes/#api-driven-experimental), but require APISIX 3.13+.
