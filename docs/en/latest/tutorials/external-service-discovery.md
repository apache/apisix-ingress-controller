In this tutorial, we will introduce how to configure external services discovery in the ApisixUpstream resources.

APISIX already supports various service discovery components, such as DNS, consul, nacos, etc.
Please see [Integration service discovery registry](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/discovery/) for details.

## Prerequisites

- An available Kubernetes cluster
- An available APISIX and APISIX Ingress Controller installation

We assume that your APISIX is installed in the `apisix` namespace.

## Introduction

Integration of APISIX Ingress with service discovery components is configured through the ApisixUpstream resource.
In this case, we don't configure the `backends` field in the ApisixRoute resource.
Instead, we will use the `upstreams` field to refer to an ApisixUpstream resources with the `discovery` field configured.

For example:

```yaml
# httpbin-route.yaml
apiVersion: apisix.apache.org/v2
kind: ApisixRoute
metadata:
  name: httpbin-route
spec:
  http:
  - name: rule1
    match:
      hosts:
      - local.httpbin.org
      paths:
      - /*
    # backends:  # We won't use the `backends` field
    #    - serviceName: httpbin
    #      servicePort: 80
    upstreams:
    - name: httpbin-upstream
```

This configuration tells the ingress controller not to resolve upstream hosts through the K8s services, but to use the configuration defined in the referenced ApisixUpstream.
The referenced ApisixUpstream *MUST* have `discovery` field configured. For example:

```yaml
# httpbin-upstream.yaml
apiVersion: apisix.apache.org/v2
kind: ApisixUpstream
metadata:
  name: httpbin-upstream
spec:
  discovery:
    type: dns
    serviceName: httpbin.default.svc.cluster.local
```

In this yaml example, we configured `httpbin.default.svc.cluster.local` as the backend.
The type of service discovery needs to be pre-configured in APISIX. For example:

```yaml
discovery:
  dns:
    servers:
      - "10.96.0.10:53" # default kube-dns cluster IP.
```

After applying the above configuration, we can try to access `httpbin.default.svc.cluster.local` directly through APISIX.
