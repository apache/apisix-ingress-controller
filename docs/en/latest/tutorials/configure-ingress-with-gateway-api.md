This tutorial will walk you through on how you can configure APISIX Ingress with the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).

Also see:

- [Configuring Ingress with Kubernetes Ingress resource](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/ingress-controller/tutorials/proxy-the-httpbin-service-with-ingress)
- [Configuring Ingress with APISIX CRDs](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/ingress-controller/tutorials/proxy-the-httpbin-service)

## Prerequisites

Before you move on, make sure you have access to a Kubernetes cluster. This tutorial uses [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube).

## Install Gateway API CRDs

Kubernetes does not have the Gateway API CRDs installed out of the box. You can install it manually by running:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v0.5.0/standard-install.yaml
```

## Install APISIX Ingress and Enable Gateway API

You can install APISIX and APISIX Ingress controller with Helm. To enable APISIX Ingress controller to work with the Gateway API, you can set the flag `--set ingress-controller.config.kubernetes.enableGatewayAPI=true` as shown below:

```shell
helm repo add apisix https://charts.apiseven.com
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
kubectl create ns ingress-apisix
helm install apisix apisix/apisix --namespace ingress-apisix \
--set gateway.type=NodePort \
--set ingress-controller.enabled=true \
--set ingress-controller.config.apisix.serviceNamespace=ingress-apisix \
--set ingress-controller.config.kubernetes.enableGatewayAPI=true
```

## Deploy httpbin

We will deploy a sample service, [kennethreitz/httpbin](https://hub.docker.com/r/kennethreitz/httpbin/), for this tutorial.

You can deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster by running:

```shell
kubectl run httpbin --image kennethreitz/httpbin --port 80
kubectl expose pod httpbin --port 80
```

## Configuring Ingress

We will use the [HTTPRoute API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/httproute/) to define Ingress. The example below shows a sample configuration that creates a Route to the httpbin service:

```yaml title="httpbin-ingress.yaml"
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: httpbin-route
spec:
  hostnames:
  - local.httpbin.org
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /
    backendRefs:
    - name: httpbin
      port: 80
```

This configuration will route all requests with host `local.httpbin.org` to the httpbin service.

You can apply it by running:

```shell
kubectl apply -f httpbin-ingress.yaml
```

## Test the created Routes

If you followed along and used minikube and `NodePort` service to expose APISIX, you can access it through the Node IP of the service `apisix-gateway`. If the Node IP is not reachable directly (if you are on Darwin, Windows, or WSL), you can create a tunnel to access the service on your machine:

```shell
minikube service apisix-gateway --url -n ingress-apisix
```

Now, you can send a `GET` request to the created Route and it will be Routed to the httpbin service:

```shell
curl --location --request GET "localhost:57687/get?foo1=bar1&foo2=bar2" -H "Host: local.httpbin.org"
```

You will receive a response similar to:

```json title="output"
{
  "args": {
    "foo1": "bar1", 
    "foo2": "bar2"
  }, 
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*", 
    "Host": "local.httpbin.org", 
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.84.0", 
    "X-Forwarded-Host": "local.httpbin.org"
  }, 
  "origin": "172.17.0.1", 
  "url": "http://local.httpbin.org/get?foo1=bar1&foo2=bar2"
}
```
