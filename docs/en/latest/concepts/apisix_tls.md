ApisixTls associates with a Kubernetes [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) resource and
generates an [APISIX SSL](http://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/admin-api#ssl) object. It asks the
Secret must have two keys `cert` and `key`, which used to store the certificate and private key in
PEM format respectively.

```shell
apiVersion: apisix.apache.org/v1
kind: ApisixTls
metadata:
  name: sample-tls
spec:
  hosts:
  - httpbin.org
  secret:
    name: htpbin-cert
    namespace: default
```

Note the `hosts` field should be written carefully, it's used by Apache APISIX to match the
correct certificate, what's more, it also should be matched with the [Server Name Indication](https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/what-is-server-name-indication#:~:text=Server%20Name%20Indication%20(SNI)%20allows,in%20the%20CLIENT%20HELLO%20message)
extension in TLS, or the TLS handshaking might fail.

The apisix-ingress-controller will watch Secret resources that referred by ApisixTls objects, once a
Secret changed, apisix-ingress-controller will re translate all referred ApisixTls objects, converting them to APISIX SSL resources ultimately.
