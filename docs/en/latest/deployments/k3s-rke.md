This document explains how you can install APISIX ingress on [k3S](https://k3s.io/) and [Rancher RKE](https://rancher.com/products/rke/).

:::tip

K3s is built for IoT and edge computing applications. Apache APISIX also supports an MQTT Plugin and runs well on ARM processors. APISIX ingress is therefore a good choice to handle North-South traffic in K3s.

:::

## Prerequisites

* Install [K3S](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/) or [Rancher RKE](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/installation/).
* Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

## Install APISIX and ingress controller

The script below installs APISIX and the ingress controller:

```shell
helm repo add apisix https://charts.apiseven.com
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
#  We use Apisix 3.0 in this example. If you're using Apisix v2.x, please set to v2
ADMIN_API_VERSION=v3
helm install apisix apisix/apisix \
  --set gateway.type=NodePort \
  --set ingress-controller.enabled=true \
  --create-namespace \
  --namespace ingress-apisix \
  --set ingress-controller.config.apisix.serviceNamespace=ingress-apisix \
  --set ingress-controller.config.apisix.adminAPIVersion=$ADMIN_API_VERSION \
  --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
kubectl get service --namespace ingress-apisix
```

:::info IMPORTANT

If you are using K3s, the default kube config file is located in `/etc/rancher/k3s/` and you make require root permission.

:::

This will create the five resources mentioned below:

* `apisix-gateway`: dataplane the process the traffic.
* `apisix-admin`: control plane that processes all configuration changes.
* `apisix-ingress-controller`: ingress controller which exposes APISIX.
* `apisix-etcd` and `apisix-etcd-headless`: stores configuration and handles internal communication.

The gateway service type is set to `NodePort`. Clients can access APISIX through the Node IPs and the assigned port. To use a service of type `LoadBalancer` with K3s, use a bare-metal load balancer implementation like [Klipper](https://github.com/k3s-io/klipper-lb).

You should now be able to use APISIX ingress controller. You can try running this [minimal example](../tutorials/proxy-the-httpbin-service.md) to see if everything is working perfectly.
