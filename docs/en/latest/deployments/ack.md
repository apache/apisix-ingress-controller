This document explains how to install Ingress APISIX on [ali-cloud ACK](https://www.aliyun.com/product/kubernetes).

## Prerequisites

* Create an ACK Service on ali-cloud.
* Download the kube config for your ACK, follow the [introduction](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/86378.html).
* Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/).
* Clone [Apache APISIX Charts](https://github.com/apache/apisix-helm-chart).
* Make sure your target namespace exists, `kubectl` operations thorough this document will be executed in namespace `ingress-apisix`.

## Install APISIX

[Apache APISIX](http://apisix.apache.org/) as the proxy plane of apisix-ingress-controller, should be deployed in advance.

```shell
cd /path/to/apisix-helm-chart
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo add apisix https://charts.apiseven.com
# Use `helm search repo apisix` to search charts about apisix
helm repo update
helm install apisix apisix/apisix \
  --set gateway.type=LoadBalancer \
  --set admin.allow.ipList="{0.0.0.0/0}" \
  --set etcd.persistence.storageClass="alicloud-disk-ssd" \
  --set etcd.persistence.size="20Gi" \
  --namespace ingress-apisix \
kubectl get service --namespace ingress-apisix
```

Two Service resources were created, one is `apisix-gateway`, which processes the real traffic; another is `apisix-admin`, which acts as the control plane to process all the configuration changes.

The gateway service type is set to `LoadBalancer` (See [Access services through SLB](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/182218.htm) for more details), so that clients can access Apache APISIX through a load balancer. You can find the load balancer ip by running:

```shell
kubectl get service apisix-gateway --namespace ingress-apisix -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip}'
```

Another thing should be concerned that the `allow.ipList` field should be customized according to the [Pod CIRD configuration of ACK](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/86500.htm), so that the apisix-ingress-controller instances can access the APISIX instances (resources pushing).

`ACK` PV require min_size is `20Gi`,cluster with `flexVolume` component select `alicloud-disk-ssd`,if with `helm values.yml` configure startup `apisix`,[more helm etcd configure](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/bitnami/etcd),configure format sample:

```yaml
etcd:
  persistence:
    storageClass: "alicloud-disk-ssd"
    size: 20Gi
```

## Install apisix-ingress-controller

You can also install apisix-ingress-controller by Helm Charts, it's recommended to install it in the same namespace with Apache APISIX.

```shell
cd /path/to/apisix-helm-chart
# install apisix-ingress-controller
helm install apisix-ingress-controller apisix/apisix-ingress-controller \
  --set image.tag=dev \
  --set config.apisix.baseURL=http://apisix-admin:9180/apisix/admin \
  --set config.apisix.adminKey=edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1 \
  --namespace ingress-apisix
```

Change the `image.tag` to the apisix-ingress-controller version that you desire. You have to Wait for while until the corresponding pods are running.

Try to create some [resources](https://github.com/apache/apisix-ingress-controller/tree/master/docs/en/latest/concepts) to verify the running status. As a minimalist example, see [proxy-the-httpbin-service](../practices/proxy-the-httpbin-service.md) to learn how to apply resources to drive the apisix-ingress-controller.
