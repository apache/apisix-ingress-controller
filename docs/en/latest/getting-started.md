## What is apisix-ingress-controller

apisix-ingress-controller is yet another Ingress controller for Kubernetes using [Apache APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org) as the high performance reverse proxy.

It's configured by using the declarative configurations like [ApisixRoute](./concepts/apisix_route.md), [ApisixUpstream](./concepts/apisix_upstream.md), [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).
All these resources are watched and converted to corresponding resources in Apache APISIX.

Service Discovery are also supported through [Kubernetes Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/),
and will be reflected to nodes in APISIX Upstream.

## Features

* Declarative configuration
* Full dynamic capabilities to delivery configurations.
* Native Kubernetes Ingress (both v1 and v1beta1) support.
* Service Discovery based on Kubernetes Service.
* Out of box support for node health check.
* Support load balancing based on Pod (upstream nodes).
* Rich plugins support.
* Easy to deploy and use.

## How It Works

See [Design](./design.md) for more details.
