# Apache APISIX for Kubernetes

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/apache/apisix-ingress-controller)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/apache/apisix-ingress-controller)

Use [Apache APISIX](https://github.com/apache/apisix#apache-apisix) for Kubernetes [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).

All configurations in `apisix-ingress-controller` are defined with Kubernetes CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions). Such as configure [plugins](https://github.com/apache/apisix/blob/master/docs/en/latest/plugins.md), Support service registration discovery mechanism for upstreams, load balancing and more in Apache APISIX.

`apisix-ingress-controller` is an Apache APISIX control plane component. Currently it serves for Kubernetes clusters. In the future, we plan to separate the submodule to adapt to more deployment modes, such as virtual machine clusters.

The technical architecture of `apisix-ingress-controller`:

## Status

This project is currently general availability.

## Features

* Declarative configuration for Apache APISIX with Custom Resource Definitions(CRDs), using k8s yaml struct with minimum learning curve.
* Hot-reload during yaml apply.
* Native Kubernetes Ingress (both `v1` and `v1beta1`) support.
* Auto register k8s endpoint to upstream (Apache APISIX) node.
* Support load balancing based on pod (upstream nodes).
* Out of box support for node health check.
* Plug-in extension supports hot configuration and immediate effect.
* Support SSL and mTLS for routes.
* Support traffic split and canary deployments.
* Support TCP 4 layer proxy.
* Ingress controller itself as a pluggable hot-reload component.
* Multi-cluster configuration distribution.

## Internal Architecture

## Prerequisites

Apisix ingress controller requires Kubernetes version 1.15+.

## Apache APISIX Ingress vs. Kubernetes Ingress Nginx

* Hot-reload during yaml apply.
* [More convenient canary deployment.](./docs/assets/en/latest/concepts/apisix_route.md)
* Verify the correctness of the configuration, safe and reliable.
* [Rich plugins and ecology.](https://github.com/apache/apisix/tree/master/docs/en/latest/plugins)
* Supports APISIX custom resources and Kubernetes native Ingress resources.
* More active community
